#My First Website

This is my first project I made on November 2020.
I learnt HTML & CSS (Flex Box & CSS Grid included), I was feeling
very confident I can build a website, so I started designing
the Brand in Adobe Illutrator (Logo & assests) then I designed
the background images in  Adobe Photoshop, completed the work in Figma, and finally coding it in VS Code.
